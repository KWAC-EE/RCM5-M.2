Currently using a brass M3 nut to screw/secure the 2230 M.2 SSD to the board, will switch to a proper surface-mount threaded socket

Mechanical alignment of mezzanine connectors is good. Adapter mounts as snug as a proper CM4 to the Mainboard. Note that U-C makes placing a piCM5 into the adapter impossible (interference with bottom SMDs)

Can't currently test due to errors in my homebrew carrier motherboard board, but perhaps I can snag another CM5 NAS motherboard to see how well the local disk acts as a cache
